## Code style

### Python

We adopt [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) as the preferred code style.

We use the following tools for linting and formatting:

- [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8): static code analyser
- [ufmt](https://github.com/omnilib/ufmt): formatter
- [pydocstyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle): sort imports


We use [pre-commit hook](https://pre-commit.com/) that checks and formats for `trailing whitespaces`, 
fixes `end-of-files` automatically on every commit.
The config for a pre-commit hook is stored in [.pre-commit-config](../.pre-commit-config.yaml).

After you clone the repository, you will need to install initialize pre-commit hook.

```shell
pip install -U pre-commit
```

From the repository folder

```shell
pre-commit install
```

After this on every commit check code linters and formatter will be enforced.

## Commit Message Convention

```
- Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters!

This reverts commit <full-hash>
More description if needed
```
